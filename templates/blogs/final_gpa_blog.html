            As you approach the end of your academic journey, your final cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) becomes a crucial metric. It's not just a number on your transcript; it's a summary of your academic performance and can significantly influence your post-graduation opportunities, including job applications, graduate school admissions, and professional certifications. Understanding how to calculate and interpret your final GPA is essential.
        </p>

        <h2 data-translate="finalGpaSection1Heading">What is Final Cumulative GPA?</h2>
        <p data-translate="finalGpaSection1Para1">
            Your final cumulative GPA represents the average of all the grades you've earned throughout your entire academic program. Unlike a semester GPA, which only considers grades from a single term, the cumulative GPA takes into account every course you've completed. It's a comprehensive measure of your overall academic standing.
        </p>

        <h2 data-translate="finalGpaSection2Heading">How to Calculate Your Final GPA</h2>
        <p data-translate="finalGpaSection2Para1">
